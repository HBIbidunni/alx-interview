# The ALX Project - Pascal's Triangle
-------------

This Python script generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows,
creating a list of lists of integers. Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical 
structure where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, 
forming a triangular pattern of numbers.

## How to Use
To use this Pascal's Triangle generator, 
call the __pascal_triangle(n) function__, 
where `n` is the number of rows needed in the triangle.
from pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

### Example: Generate Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows
triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
print(triangle)

## Function Description
The pascal_triangle function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle up to `n rows`.

__Example Output__
For `n = 5`, the sample is like this:

[
    [1],
    [1, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 3, 3, 1],
    [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]

For `n = 5`, the generated __Pascal's Triangle__ would look like this:

|        |        |        |        |   1    |        |        |        |
|        |        |        |   1    |        |   1    |        |        |
|        |        |   1    |        |   2    |        |   1    |        |
|        |   1    |        |   3    |        |   3    |        |   1    |
|   1    |        |   4    |        |   6    |        |   4    |        |   1    |

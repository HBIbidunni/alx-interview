# Minimum Operations; The ALX Project
-------------

In this project, the task is to solve a problem that involves 
finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific target 
using two basic operations: __copy__ and __paste__. The goal is to develop 
a function that computes the minimum steps required to reach the desired 
number of characters, given these constraints.

## Problem Statement
Starting with a single character `H`, only two operations can be performed:

- `Copy All`: Copy all characters currently in the editor.
- `Paste`: Paste the copied characters at the end of the existing ones.
Given a target integer `n`, the objective is to find the minimum number of 
operations required to have exactly `n` characters of `H` in the file.
